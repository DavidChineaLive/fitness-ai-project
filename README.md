# FitnessAI
FitnessAI is a fitness assistant that uses TensorFlow to track body joints through a camera feed, calculating angles to precisely count completed exercises like dumbbell curls. For instance, it can detect shoulder, elbow, and wrist movements to accurately tally reps and provide real-time feedback. The app also integrates Google Gemini for meal recognition and calorie tracking and Hugging Face API to deliver motivational coaching through a chatbot. Itâ€™s an all-in-one fitness solution that combines cutting-edge technology with a seamless user experience.
